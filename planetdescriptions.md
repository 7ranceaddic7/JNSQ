### Eve
Eve is an exceptionally purple planet, presumably possessing just enough of a rare substance to tint its oceans and horizons, like how one drop of any additive can remarkably change the flavor of a mug of juice. Fortunately, nobody has made the claim...yet, that Eve is full of grape juice.
#### Gilly
Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve. It was once and for a long time believed to be the smallest natural satellite that the Kerbal Astronomical Society ever discovered, but that changed when the concept of colonizing the asteroid field suddenly became very interesting to those who weren't afraid of it.

### Edna
A lonely and dark world within the local asteroid belt, most likely named after a very grumpy female scientist, Edna turned out to be harder to recognize as a planet than Dres was. Kerbal astronomers eventually realized that unlike any of the large asteroids around, Edna was particularly round, and that it would, in few but regular cases, occlude something or be occluded.

### Lindor
The seventh major planet, Lindor is amazingly large and is the same kind as Jool. Its swirls are fainter and calmer, instilling a particularly restful feeling into onlookers. A critical question has been raised recently- whether Lindor contains water or chocolate.
#### Krel
This small pale world orbits its parent very closely, and was very hard to distinguish until a lead astronomer lost his telescope and had to obtain a new and shinier one. He became very concerned for his age when he noted Krel's vainy appearance.
#### Aden
Aden is a small brown marble sitting in Lindor's preverbial hand. It seems like a rocky world much like the Mun or Edna but its proximity to Lindor suggests it may be very different inside. Well, that's what the old scientists with afros said to write for this.
#### Riga
The largest brown marble in Lindor's hand, Riga is deemed the most interesting of them all. Its size and other observable characteristics make it as interesting as Tylo among Jool's moons. A large portion of its surface even has a subtle but clear familiarity to Kerbin.
#### Talos
The only thing that's far off about Talos is its distance from Riga or from Lindor. Its near neutral inclination suggests that it either formed here or was quickly stabilized after being captured. Its strong colorations may yield much scientific fruit when someone gets out there to sample it.

### Hamek
This wonderfully mis-colored world dances and sways in and out of the depths of Kuiper Kerman's Belt. At this level of distance, expectation is high that only ice planets can exist here, so Hamek's redness is currently beyond all reason.
