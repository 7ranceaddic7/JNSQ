# JNSQ
Of the French phrase *"Je Ne Sais Quoi,"* meaning *"Something (such as an appealing quality) that cannot be adequately described or expressed,"* JNSQ seeks to be a finely crafted, freshly exciting and intensely challenging planet pack. Galileo's Planet Pack "GPP" as many have come to know, has broken many conventions and raised the bar very high for high-quality, challenging, career-friendly planet packs. But now it is regarded as only a stepping stone to this. Everything that Team Galileo has done for and learned from GPP, has been or is being put into practice here.

Unlike GPP, JNSQ does not remove the stock planets but rather, does reimagine and reinvent them, destroying what you think you know about some of them, and fills out the local planetary system, providing several all new worlds to discover.

## Logic
Many KSP modders have considered that while the stock parts (namely, engines) are overpowered for stock scale, they are tuned just right for 2.5x scale. With this in mind, JNSQ is built in natively 2.7x scale, modestly larger than 2.5x for ease of writing and remembering numbers such as Kerbin's radius which is rounded to the nearest 100. **Sigma Dimensions** and **Rescale!** are not required for this mod to function, and will be *highly discouraged* from use alognside this mod.

## Recommended Mods
### Parts
* [Eve Optimized Engines](https://github.com/OhioBob/Eve-Optimized-Engines/releases) what it says on the tin.
* [JX2 Antenna](https://spacedock.info/mod/1107/JX2Antenna) late-game antennae made to reduce the need to spam RA-15 and RA-100 and preclude the need to install Custom Barn Kit.

### Utilities
* [CommNet Antennas Info](https://spacedock.info/mod/2039/CommNet%20Antennas%20Info) expands the panel info for antennae in the  VAB.
* [Antenna Helper](https://spacedock.info/mod/1730/Antenna%20Helper) adequately and easily shows the power and ranges of combined antenna in VAB, flight and the Tracking Station.
* [Kronometer](https://github.com/StollD/Kronometer/releases) enables in-game time to display in custom hours per Kerbin day. 
* [Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://spacedock.info/mod/699/Kerbal%20Alarm%20Clock) now works with Kronometer; lets you easily mark the times for maneuvers and encounters in many flights.
* [Sigma Replacements](https://github.com/Sigma88/Sigma-Replacements/releases) a suite of tiny Sigma mods for changing things such as the main menu scene, kerbal suits, and the skybox.
