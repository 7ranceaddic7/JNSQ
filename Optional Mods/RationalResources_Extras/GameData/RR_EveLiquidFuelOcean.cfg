// Installs LiquidFuel into Eve's oceans. Also adds a LiquidFuel harvester module to the XM-G50 air scoop. The idea of this is both very necessary on one hand and very silly on the other hand. The purpose for this config is to make Eve's oceans playable and directly involved in ISRU gameplay. 
// LqdMethane cannot exist here as it is a very light hydrocarbon and is cryogenic (only found on cold outer worlds) while Eve is a hot inner planet. Unofrtunately LiquidFuel is the only sensible option that avoids introducing a new resource and an unneeded new converter chain.
