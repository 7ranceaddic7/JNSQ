# JNSQ Localization
Localization is easy to do and highly appreciated to receive. If you would like to contribute, all that is required is to copy and rename the **en-us.cfg** file, rename it to suit your language, and change the config node string at the top, inside the file (see :`en-us {}`), to match the filename to enable your language. Of course, you must finally supply translations of all the English texts inside.

* `en-us` for English US
* `de-de` for German
* `es-es` for Spanish
* `es-mx` for Mexican Spanish
* `fr-fr` for French
* `it-it` for Italian (not confirmed)
* `ja` for Japanese
* `pt-br` for Portugese-Brazilian
* `ru` for Russian
* `zh-cn` for Chinese Simplified
