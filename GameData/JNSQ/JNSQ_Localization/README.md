# JNSQ Localization
Localization is easy to do and highly appreciated to receive. If you would like to contribute, all that is required is to copy and rename the **en-us.cfg** file to suit your language, and change the config node string at the top, inside the file (see: `en-us {}` ), to match the filename to enable your language. Of course, you must finally supply translations of all the English texts inside.

The options below are used to represent languages for KSP. If you see a file existing that uses any of these for its name then that language has been done. If you wanted to provide for a language that has already been done, you are welcome to inspect or proof-read it and offer up better translations if you can.

* `en-us` for English US
* `de-de` for German
* `es-es` for Spanish
* `es-mx` for Mexican Spanish
* `fr-fr` for French
* `it-it` for Italian (not confirmed)
* `ja` for Japanese
* `pt-br` for Portugese-Brazilian
* `ru` for Russian
* `zh-cn` for Chinese Simplified
