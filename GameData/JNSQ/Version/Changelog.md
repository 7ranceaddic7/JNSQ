# JNSQ

## 0.7.1 Change log (WIP)
* Updated Rational Resources bundle to 1.0.0. [Full changelog here](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/RationalResources/releases/tag/1.0.0).
* Added loading screen images. Contributors' names in filenames.
* Added more loading tips.
* Added Kerbal Konstructs facilities:
  * Welcome Back Island (Downrange center for reusability programs. Includes change to Kerbin terrain and its own biome).
  * KSC Harbor with water launch.
  * Alternate Woomerang, named "Woomera2." Appears nearby to the DLC site.
  * Alternate Dessert Airfield named "Darude." Includes 2 wunays, 1 launchpad, 4 landing pads. Uses Kopernicus to disable the actual Dessert Airfield.
  * Musgrave Space Center for purely vertical space programs. Includes 2 launchpads, 3 landing pads, no facilities for planes.
  * Air Base with 4 runways.
  * C. Yeager Space Center for rival space programs. Includes its own harbor, 2 runways, 2 launchpads and 3 landing pads.
  * 2x mountain-top observatory complexes with helipads (no spawn) and Lv3 DSN.
  * These require only OSSNTR (Omega's Stockalike Structures: No Textures Required). Some of these have modules on them for trading fuel, staffing with kerbals (there's a special condition for this which is unknown) and farming funds or science. Some of these need to be spotted with SCANsat's anomaly detector. Most of these special modules need to be purchased and opened to use.
* Fixed Kerbin biome map: Arid Mountains was missing.
* Fixed Eve planetshine color. Should no longer be default purple.
* Updated CelesitalBodies.pdf: fixed minor error.
* Updated Duna biome map: 
  * 14 biomes including 5 variants of craters.
* Updated Eve biome map: 
  * Added 11 seas named after modders or mods whose names relate to monsters.
  * Methane Lakes renamed to Petrol Lakes.
* Updated Tam biome map: 
  * Added 3 biomes. Thanks to CoriW, maker of Planet Arkas.
* Updated solar panel catch-all config.
* Updated Rational Resources settings:
  * Eve's Shores now always Ore rich to make LFO (Kerolox) production from (near to the) Petrol Lakes convenient.
  * Added/Fixed some options for atmo edge mining.
