# JNSQ

## 0.7.1 Change log (WIP)
* Updated Rational Resources bundle to 1.0.0. [Full changelog here](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/RationalResources/releases/tag/1.0.0).
* Added loading screen images. Contributors' names in filenames.
* Added more loading tips.
* Added several Kerbal Konstructs facilities. 
  * These require only OSSNTR (Omega's Stockalike Structures: No Textures Required). 
  * Most of these allow for KerbinSide airport alike experience. All of these have (not necessarily all at once) modules on them for trading fuel, expanding antenna coverage, staffing with kerbals and farming funds or science. Most of these need to be spotted with SCANsat's anomaly detector and everything needs to be purchased in career mode.
* Fixed Kerbin biome map: Arid Mountains was missing.
* Fixed Eve planetshine color. Should no longer be default purple.
* Updated CelesitalBodies.pdf: fixed minor error.
* Updated Duna biome map: 
  * 14 biomes including 5 variants of craters.
* Updated Eve biome map: 
  * Added 11 seas named after modders or mods whose names relate to monsters.
  * Methane Lakes renamed to Petrol Lakes.
* Updated Tam biome map: 
  * Added 3 biomes. Thanks to CoriW, maker of Planet Arkas.
* Updated solar panel catch-all config.
* Updated Rational Resources settings:
  * Eve's Shores now always Ore rich to make LFO (Kerolox) production from (near to the) Petrol Lakes convenient.
  * Added/Fixed some options for atmo edge mining.
