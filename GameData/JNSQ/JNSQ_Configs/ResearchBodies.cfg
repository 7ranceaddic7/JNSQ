		Edna = Just when we though Dres was alone in being leagues larger than anything in the asteroid belt.
		Dak = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly, but we're glad it is where it is. Do you think there is more of it?
		Lindor = There's a really large blue dot. A really really large blue dot. It's nearly as big as Jool!
		Krel = We've found something. Seems incredibly small but it's clearly orbiting the giant. Is it a huge asteroid?
		Aden = We found a brown dot. We found a lot of brown dots. This system is officially full of chocolate sprinkles.
		Riga = Oh hello. A very sizable target has entered our sights. It's fuzzy enough to possibly have an atmosphere too.
		Talos = This moon is a bit splotchy. Good thing it's big and easy to spot.
		Hamek = There's a strong red pixel. Is this screen dying? Or is that actually how this planet is?
		Celes = What's small, dark, and cold? This moon! Also, the chunk of meat that's getting freezer-burn in the fridge on 3rd floor.
		Tam = Bruh.
		Nara = What's this? A planet? But it's so far past Lindor! Is it rogue? Or has it always been here?
		Anon = Wow this moon is dark! Is it a chip off of its parent's block?
		Emos = Sensor spike detected! Recalibrating. The albedo on this moon is concerningly high.
		Prax = The main planet can't be rogue! The number of moons is too damn high!
