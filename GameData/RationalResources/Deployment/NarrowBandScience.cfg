		default = Warning: Unable to classify this celestial body. Either the body is not configured and holds no resources, or its report is undefined.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Scan inconclusive. Baseline measurements for Sun stellar medium saved. Report saved.
		SunInSpaceLow = Star classification: Population 1. Metallicity rating: High. Karboundum presence is fair, Antimatter presence is weak.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Metal. This planet is rich in metals, radioactive material and very poor in Ore and Water-bearing materials.
		MohoInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		EveInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. Eve is by far a mineral and Rocky world, with a potential strong balance of many other materials, and seems poor in radioactives.
		EveInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Carbonaceous. Trace atmosphere composition: None. Eve's high gravity may have dragged down anything of value other than Hydrogen.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Metal. This planet is rich in metals, radioactive material and very poor in Ore and Water-bearing materials.
		GillyInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere composition: None. Gilly is evidently unable to hold onto any considerable amount of materials in the wake of Eve's gravity well.

		MunInSpaceLow = The Mun has a modest store of metals, Minerals, Rock and Gypsum behind its blanket of Oxygen. Detecting highly scattered, highly dense concentrations of Water and rare materials. Further scanning is required. Trace atmosphere profiled: Unique. Oxygen, Rock and Water found.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. Minmus is in fact not composed of ice cream but of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Water-bearing compounds. No metals detected. There may not be a trace atmosphere here.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere not detected. No radioactives detected. Carbon presence is very poor.
		
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. Duna's surface is very rich in radioactives, metals and bound Carbon Dioxide.
