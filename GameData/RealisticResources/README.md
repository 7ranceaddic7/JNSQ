# Realistic Resources
Realistic Resources is inspired by [Realistic Atmospheres](https://github.com/OhioBob/Realistic-Atmospheres) made by [OhioBob](https://github.com/OhioBob/), and is designed to operate on the KSP Community Resource Pack and perform the following:
To strip out the entirely random resource distributions and to apply carefully crafted templates (groups of resource distributions) according to the logically expected class and composition of a body. 

This mod enables planet makers to easily assign custom and appropriate distributions to their planet packs and skip the headaches of figuring out and writing the individual nodes themselves, and assorting all of their writings into several per-resource config files.
